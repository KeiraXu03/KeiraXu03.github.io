A vision–language framework for solving jigsaw puzzles with **eroded gaps**, where
visual cues alone (edge matching, coherence) are insufficient and textual context
provides crucial semantic guidance.

- Core contribution: the **Vision-Language Hierarchical Semantic Alignment (VLHSA)**
  module, aligning visual patches with textual descriptions through multi-level
  semantic matching from local tokens to global context.
- Multimodal architecture combining **dual visual encoders (including a Mamba /
  state-space backbone)** with language features for cross-modal reasoning.
- Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art vision-only models across datasets,
  with a **+14.2 percentage-point** gain in piece accuracy; ablations confirm the
  critical role of the VLHSA module.
